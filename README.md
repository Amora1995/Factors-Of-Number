# Factors-Of-Number
Python Program to find the factors of a number
In this program, the number whose factor is to be found is stored in num.
Then we display its factors using the function print_factors(). 
 In the function, we use a for loop to iterate from 1 to that number and only print it if, it perfectly divides our number. 
 Here, print_factors() is a user-defined function.
